Using Machine Learning models to predict salary ranges.

## Abstract
In this project, we built Machine Learning models that
generate salary range estimates for jobs in the field of Software
Engineering and Computer science. The dataset was
collected by scraping job offers found by means of keyword
search on the popular job board site Indeed. A combination
of feature extraction and text classification methods were
employed in this study to train and test the proposed salary
prediction models. The text vectorization techniques that
were leveraged are the Bag of Words, Term Frequency, TFIDF,
and N-gram models. The classification algorithms that
were employed for salary class prediction are the Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Stochastic Gradient Descent
models. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and f1-score were used to compare the success of
the models. Cross-validation was used to validate accuracy,
and hyperparameter search was used to improve performance
results.
